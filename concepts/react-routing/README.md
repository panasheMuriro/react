# React Routing Client side

- I learned how to implement client-side routing in a React app using React Router. 
- This lesson covers setting up basic routes, creating simple pages, and navigating between them without full page reloads. 
- I used `<BrowserRouter>, <Route>, <Switch>, and <Link>` components to handle navigation and render pages based on URL paths.
