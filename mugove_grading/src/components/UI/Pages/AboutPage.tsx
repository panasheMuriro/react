                and also on each and every topic they attempt so that their weaknesses can be exposed, 
                and this will make helping the student much easier.

            <ol >
            <li>Add a class</li>
            <li>Add students taking that class</li>
            <li>Add a syllabus for that class</li>
            <li>Add an exercise to be graded</li>

            <li>Grade each and every student in the class</li>
